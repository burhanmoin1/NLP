This will scrape listings from Craigslist and save the extracted data to "export.csv".

Description:

The script starts by defining the URL to scrape (Craigslist Sacramento) and removing any existing "export.csv" file. It then iterates through pages of listings, extracting information such as title, price, phone number, URL, and image URL for each listing. Additionally, it utilizes the EleutherAI library to estimate the price of each listing and includes this estimated price in the scraped data. Finally, it writes the extracted data to a CSV file named "export.csv".
